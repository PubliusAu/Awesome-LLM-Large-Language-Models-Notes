## What so special about HuggingFace?
- HuggingFace, a popular NLP library, but it also offers an easy way to deploy models via their Inference API. When you build a model using the HuggingFace library, you can then train it and upload it to their Model Hub. From there, they offer a scalable compute backend which serves models hosted in the hub. With just a few lines of code, and for the price of a few dollars per day, anyone can deploy secure, scalable NLP models built with the HuggingFace library.
